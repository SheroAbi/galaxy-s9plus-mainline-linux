# Performance, and how each number was measured

Four changes turned this port from "it runs" into "it runs well". Each one is
here with the measurement that justified it, because three of them looked
like something else first.

## 1. CMA -- the reason everything felt slow

**Symptom:** the desktop lagged, the compositor missed frames, and the log
was full of scanout buffer allocation errors.

**Cause:** the CMA region was 128 MiB. One 1440x2960x4 frame is 16.3 MiB, so
exactly one fitted. The second `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB` returned `ENOMEM`,
and the compositor fell back to a CPU copy for every frame.

**Fix:** a 320 MiB `linux,cma` region at `0x98000000` -- below 4 GB, because
DECON's scanout address register is 32 bit.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| allocation errors | continuous | 0 |
| frames reaching the panel | CPU copy path | 60/s |

## 2. The flip latch -- "first an artefact, then it loads"

**Symptom:** clicking anything showed garbage for a moment before the real
content appeared.

**Cause:** the page flip programmed DECON's scanout address and returned
without waiting for the shadow registers to latch it. The address took effect
mid-frame.

**Fix:** the vendor's `wait_update_done_and_mask` half of the handshake, with
a 250 us poll and a 50 ms timeout. See [04-drivers.md](04-drivers.md).

## 3. GPU rail before GPU clock

**Symptom:** `DATA_INVALID_FAULT` from Panfrost every few seconds, and two
kernels that hung during boot.

**Cause:** sboot leaves BUCK6 at 644 mV and the GPU at 260 MHz. Panfrost was
binding at 0.9 s and driving the GPU on that rail.

**Fix:** `s9p-g3d` became a platform driver that raises BUCK6 to 950 mV first
and only then publishes the clock. Until it does, panfrost gets
`-EPROBE_DEFER`. Plus the glitch-free mux switch, which removed the faults
that came with every devfreq rate change.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| GPU faults after a full load run | 16 in 2 min | 0 |
| temperature under GPU load | 66 C | 58 C |
| panfrost probe | 14.3 s | 0.9 s |

The probe time also needed the GPU's OPP table moved **inside** the `gpu`
node: `fw_devlink` treats `operating-points-v2` as a supplier link, and a
sibling table delayed the probe by 13 seconds on its own.

## 4. AFBC repacking -- the artefacts in icons and text

**Symptom:** icons and glyphs showed **horizontal dashes exactly 16 pixels
long**. glmark2 was completely clean; only the desktop was affected.

That combination is not a contradiction, it is the clue. glmark2 draws
geometry and loads almost no textures; a desktop lives on icon and glyph
textures.

**Cause:** not the kernel. Mesa 25.2's AFBC **repacking** (`afbc_pack`) on
Mali-G72 r0p1 writes some blocks incompletely. 16 pixels of RGBA is 64 bytes,
one cache line. Static textures get repacked; render targets never do -- which
is exactly why the benchmark was clean.

**Fix:** `PAN_MAX_AFBC_PACKING_RATIO=0` in `/etc/environment`.

`PAN_MESA_DEBUG=noafbc` also fixes the artefacts and is the **wrong** choice:

| glmark2 test (1080x1920) | AFBC on (as shipped) | `noafbc` | `packing_ratio=0` |
|---|---|---|---|
| build | 747 | 839 | 919 |
| texture | 988 | 1105 | 1139 |
| shading | 911 | 1068 | 1093 |
| bump | 1344 | 809 | 1764 |
| **desktop** | **217** | **18** | **218** |
| **Score** | **840** | 766 | **1025** |

`noafbc` costs the desktop test a factor of twelve. `packing_ratio=0` keeps
the full performance and removes the artefacts.

### How that was found, and what it rules out

Reusable method:

1. **Read the real screen out of `/dev/mem`.** The live scanout address is in
   DECON's IDMA register at `0x16070000 + 0x1000*(1+ch) + 0x40`. Read
   1440*2960*4 bytes from there and save a PNG -- that is exactly what the
   user sees, without having to ask them.
2. **Capture twice, seconds apart, and compare hashes.** Bit-identical means a
   frozen texture, not a per-frame drawing error.
3. **Force a full rebuild** by switching the display off and on. If the damage
   survives, it is in the texture, not in the compositing.
4. **Read the structure.** 1-pixel-high runs of 16 pixels are linear 64-byte
   losses. 4x4 blocks would have meant u-interleaved tiling.
5. **Only then** try the Mesa switches.

Two false leads this ruled out:

* **The CPU write path.** The suspicion was that cache lines from zeroing
  shmem were overwriting write-combined writes -- exactly what
  `should_map_wc()` warns about. A test that allocated 120 buffers through
  the panfrost ioctls, wrote a pattern, flooded the caches with 96 MB and read
  back found **0 bad bytes**.
* **Compositing.** The damage survived a full display off/on bit-identically.

### Measuring anything in the session: read this first

`/etc/environment.d/` does **not** reach `gnome-shell`; `/etc/environment`
(pam_env) does. And the `systemd --user` manager keeps its environment across
`systemctl restart gdm` -- a removed value survived three measurements that
way. Always:

    loginctl terminate-user ubuntu
    systemctl restart gdm

## Where it stands

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `gnome-shell` CPU at an idle desktop | 12.4 % | 1.2 % |
| idle temperature | 52 C | 43-46 C |
| glmark2 score | 840 | 1025 |

## Still open: screen transfer at 1080p

Mirroring the phone's screen to a PC through a GNOME screen-cast is bound by
`gnome-shell`, not by the link:

| capture resolution | frames/s |
|---|---|
| 1920x1080 | 9 |
| 1280x720 | 19 |
| 960x540 | 31-41 |

Exactly linear in pixel count, with `gnome-shell` at 91.7 % CPU. A gdb profile
points at `clutter_stage_paint_to_buffer` then
`cogl_framebuffer_read_pixels_into_bitmap`.

Mutter does advertise DMABuf (`Video:modifier` shows up in
`pw-cli enum-params`, and `libgstpipewire.so` contains `memory:DMABuf`), but a
pipeline override asking for `video/x-raw(memory:DMABuf)` still negotiated
system memory -- and the extra render pass Mutter does for a *virtual*
monitor, not the copy, is what dominates. Unresolved.
